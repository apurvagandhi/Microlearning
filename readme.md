# Micro-Learning App 🎓

> A collaborative open-source micro-learning platform built by 14 CS students from NC State University during a month-long hackathon in partnership with the NC State InSPIRE program.

## 📌 Project Overview

A modern web application designed to help learners acquire knowledge through bite-sized, multi-modal learning experiences. The platform supports:
- **Text-based learning** - concise lessons and summaries
- **Visual learning** - diagrams, infographics, and illustrations
- **Audio learning** - podcasts, spoken explanations
- **Writing practice** - exercises and quizzes

### 🎯 Goals
- Teach open-source development best practices to student developers
- Build a scalable, production-ready micro-learning platform
- Complete full-stack development cycle: design → coding → testing → deployment → CI/CD

## 💻 Tech Stack (Placeholder - To Be Decided)

> **⚠️ PLACEHOLDER TECH STACK**: The technologies listed below are placeholder suggestions only. We will have **GitHub Discussions and meetings** to review pros/cons of each option before making final decisions. All students will have input in this decision-making process.

### Frontend (Placeholder: Angular)
- **Might use: Angular** with TypeScript
- **Alternatives to discuss**: React, Vue.js, or other frameworks
- Components, routing, state management TBD based on team decision

### Backend (Placeholder: Java)
- **Might use: Java** with Spring Boot
- **Alternatives to discuss**: Python + FastAPI, Node.js + Express, or other frameworks
- Database, API design, authentication TBD based on team decision

### DevOps & CI/CD (To Be Determined)
- **Considering**: AWS, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker
- Specific choices will be decided based on team preferences and requirements

---

## 🗳️ How We'll Decide the Tech Stack

1. **Review & Discuss** - Review pros/cons of different options
2. **GitHub Discussions** - Team shares ideas and preferences
3. **Evaluate** - Consider learning curve, project needs, career skills
4. **Vote** - Team votes on final choices
5. **Commit** - Use chosen stack for the 10-day hackathon

**Your input matters!** Every student gets a say in these decisions.

## 👥 Team Roles

Each student should own a clear responsibility:
- **2x Frontend Leads** - architecture, component design
- **2x Backend Leads** - API design, database schema
- **2x Full-Stack/DevOps** - CI/CD, deployment, Docker
- **2x QA/Testing** - automated tests, bug reports
- **2x UI/UX Design + Documentation** - mockups, user guides
- **2x Technical Project Managers** - sprint coordination, issue triage

## 🗓️ Month-long Hackathon (10 Hands-on Days)

The project runs over approximately one month. During this period there are 10 dedicated "hands-on" coding days where students will implement, test, and integrate features. The remaining days are reserved for planning, design, setup, reviews, and presentations.

### Week 1: Planning & Architecture
- [ ] Introduction to project
- [ ] Set up project management (GitHub Discussions, Projects board)
- [ ] Set up Google Chat
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository and project structure 

### Week 2: Design & Setup
- [ ] Discuss, Decide and Design complete architecture
- [ ] Discuss, Decide and Define API endpoints
- [ ] Discuss, Decide and Create database schema
- [ ] Discuss, Decide and Design UI mockups
- [ ] Set up local environment
- [ ] Discuss, Decide and Set up CI/CD and AWS resources

### Weeks 3 & 4: Implementation — 10 Hands-on Days
- [ ] Frontend: Layout, authentication UI
- [ ] Backend: Authentication, user management, database setup
- [ ] Integration: Frontend ↔ Backend
- [ ] Iterative feature development, code reviews, and testing

### Final Days: Polish, Testing & Presentation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployment to production
- [ ] Prepare presentation and live demo

Notes:
- The schedule is flexible; organizers may distribute the 10 hands-on days across Weeks 3 & 4 as needed.
- Use GitHub Issues and Projects to mark which days are hands-on and to assign responsibilities.
